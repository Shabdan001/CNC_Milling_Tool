# CNC Milling Machine - Tool Wear Detection
Problem Statement A series of machining experiments were run on 2" x 2" x 1.5" wax blocks in a CNC milling machine in the System-level Manufacturing and Automation Research Testbed (SMART) at the University of Michigan. Machining data was collected from a CNC machine for variations of tool condition, feed rate, and clamping pressure. Each experiment produced a finished wax part with an "S" shape - S for smart manufacturing - carved into the top face

# GOAL
The goal of our project is to predict the wear of parts on a CNC milling machine
